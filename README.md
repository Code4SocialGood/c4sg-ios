# c4sg-ios

Project Title
Code4SocialGood iOS application

Getting Started
To get started please create your own development branch from the project's development branch. Master will not be used until we are ready to build and publish to the app store.
After cloning the branch you will want to go into the project and open the Code4SocialGood.xcworkspace file.

The reason why we are using the Code4SocialGood.xcworkspace file over the traditional .xcodeproj file is because this is what is created when cocoapods are used in a project.

What are CocoaPods?

If you have never worked with a package manager before this is what Cocoapods are for iOS.

If you have worked with a package manager before like Maven, NuGet, NPM, etc. then this is the equivalent to iOS as it manages our dependencies.
CocoaPods are configured through a file called a Podfile and we use terminal commands in order to get our pods.

To make things easier the cocoapods to get started have already been configured to the project there may be a need to have more in the future depending on requirements there will be an opportunity to use this feature if you have quesitons about Cocoa Pods reach out to Brian Andreasen on slack.

How to Install CocoaPods?

Please visit https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html

Prerequisites
XCode
iOS Simulator or Live device for testing purposes (It's highly recommended to use a live device in the later stages).
CocoaPods
GitHub or GitHub Desktop
Willingness to learn together to create something awesome.

Give examples
Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

1. Check your first to see if you have XCode installed most iOS developers should already have this installed.
2. To check if XCode is installed click on 'Finder' then click on 'Go' in the menu bar next it should dropdown and you should be able to see applicaitons. Click on applications.
  If you don't have XCode installed you will need to install it from the Mac App Store.

  Mac App Store Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12

  This will take some time to download and may require OS updates in order to install.
  If Xcode requires a minor OS update you should be safe to install.
  If XCode requires a MAJOR Mac OS update please backup your information using Time Machine to an external hard disk or only backup the pertinent information that is important prior to proceeding with an OS update.
  A major OS update that fails may require the hard disk to be formatted(erased) and re-partitioned in order to re-install properly.
  
3. Once XCode has been installed you're now ready to get going!

Running Tests/Automated Testing

We are not currently running automated tests or tests yet as we are still getting started as we get ready to publish to the App store this will be explored further.

Versioning

GitHub is used for version control a basic knowledge of GitHub on how to create a branch, commit, and perform pull requests is not assumed and if you need help with these features please reach out to help on the Slack community channel for the cs4g-iOS project.

Questions

Please reach out to Brian Andreasen or anyone else if you have any feedback or have difficulties on getting started.
Happy Coding!
